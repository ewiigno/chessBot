# chessBot (NOT FINISHED!)

This bot is using discord.js and is made to play chess on your discord server
Important note: all commands displayed need to be used with a prefix. The standard prefix is `!` . For example you type `!help` instead of `help`.

# How to get this bot
Download the files and run chess.js with node (I will probably find a better solution when IÂ´m finished with this bot).

## All commands for this bot
#### commands in every channel
```
help   => show all available commands
challenge [username/nickname/id]   => challenge a player for a chess game
accept   => accept first of outstanding challenges
accept [username/nickname/id]   => accept a specific challenge
deny   => deny all challenges
deny [username/nickname/id]   => deny a specific challenge
```

#### commands in a chess channel
```
move [currentField] [endField]    => move a piece

surrender    => surrender
draw   => offers your opponent a draw
draw [accept/deny/offer]   => accepts/denies/offers a draw

delete   => delete this channel when the game is over 
```

## How to use it?

### Start a game
First you need to challenge an other player that is a member of your guild. Do this by using `challenge [username/nickname/id]`. As you can see you can use the name, the nickname or the id of this user. You can have several challenges active at the same time.
To accept a challenge you need to use either `accept [username/nickname/id]` or just `accept`. With these commands you accept the first challenge that fits.

### How to play 
When a challenge gets accepted, a new channel will appear. This is where these two players can play their own game. Again, there can be several games at the same time.
The most important command is `move [currentField] [endField]`. This is how you move your pieces. The fields in this commands display the coordinates on a chess game which are always one letter and one number. An example for this command with the standard prefix is `move c2 c3`. Be aware that a move must be possible.

### After game is over
When the game is over you can still type and use commands but it won't do anything. If you want to delete this channel it is highly recommended to use `delete` in this channel instead of deleting it in discord. This will clear space for the bot.
